<p><strong>Benefits of Living in a Community</strong></p>

<p>There are several reasons the number of community associations has exploded from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands over the decades. The benefits our homeowners enjoy most are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Maintained Property Values.</strong> According to the Community Associations Institute, homes in managed communities are often worth 5 percent more than those in traditional communities.</li>
	<li><strong>Amenities and Services.</strong> Our homeowners receive value in return for their choice to invest in a homeowners association.</li>
	<li><strong>Sense of Community.</strong> Our community is a place to connect in a world that is increasingly disconnected.</li>
</ul>
